The project propose a new method for 3D reconstruction that replaces the need of using stereo cameras for a monocular camera combining modern techniques of Computer vision and CG in order to archieve a similar surface to the image captured by the camera. The captured image will be a non structured scene which will allow to navigate and interaction on this surface.
