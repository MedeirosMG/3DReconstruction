The project propose a new method for 3D reconstruction that replaces the need of using stereo cameras for a monocular camera combining modern techniques of Computer vision and CG in order to archieve a similar surface to the image captured by the camera. The captured image will be a non structured scene which will allow to navigate and interaction on this surface.

Tutorial to open this project:
- First of all, you need to install Visual Studio 2017
- Download the source on GitHub (https://github.com/MedeirosMG/3DReconstruction)
- Execute the file "Reconstruction.vcxproj" and then the project will open
- Done, now you can use this project
